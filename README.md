# 📄 Resume–Job Description Analyzer (AI-Powered)

A full-stack generative AI application that analyzes a candidate’s resume against a job description, identifies skill alignment and gaps, and provides structured, recruiter-style feedback.
The system is live deployed and usable end-to-end.

## Architecture

React Frontend (Vercel)  
→ FastAPI Backend (Render)  
→ OpenRouter LLM API

The frontend sends PDF files and metadata to the backend.  
The backend extracts text, performs AI analysis, validates the output schema, and returns structured results to the frontend.
